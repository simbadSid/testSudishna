Bug fixes:
	- The initial list of foods (attribute of the class "MgmInterviewFoodSort") has been declared as static in order to be accessed by the "main" function (which is static)
	- In class Tomato, we have removed the redefinition of the attribute "size": this attribute is not accessed by the sort function which access the "size" of the parent class "Food"
	- In the sort function "main", we have removed the "final" qualification of the index used to store the maximum at each iteration.   Indeed, this index needs most often to be modified.

Code improvements:
// TODO ***************
	- Change name of "main" to "sort"
	- Add function "print" or "toString" and remove it from "main"
	- Change the name of the array potatoes
	- Add a builder of "potatoes" and "tomatoes" with parameter "size"
